      <h1>Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>
      <h2>Data Structures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Segment Trees:</strong>
          <div>
            Why Not Mastered: Segment trees are often used in scenarios that
            require efficient range queries and updates, which might not come up
            frequently in typical coding problems or projects. The complexity of
            building and querying segment trees can be daunting without
            consistent practice.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees):</strong>
          <div>
            Why Not Mastered: Fenwick trees are used for cumulative frequency
            tables and are less intuitive than simpler structures like arrays
            and linked lists. They require understanding of bit manipulation and
            efficient querying, which can be challenging without regular use.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trie (Prefix Trees):</strong>
          <div>
            Why Not Mastered: Tries are specialized for string operations and
            can be complex to implement. They are not as commonly encountered in
            general programming tasks unless working with problems involving
            large dictionaries or autocomplete features.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Red-Black Trees:</strong>
          <div>
            Why Not Mastered: Red-Black trees are a type of self-balancing
            binary search tree. The balancing logic and rotations can be
            complex, and understanding their properties requires a deeper dive
            into tree data structures.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>B-Trees:</strong>
          <div>
            Why Not Mastered: B-Trees are used in databases and filesystems for
            their ability to handle large amounts of data efficiently. The
            complexity of their node splitting and balancing makes them harder
            to grasp without specific use cases.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Radix Sort:</strong>
          <div>
            Why Not Mastered: Radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm
            that sorts numbers by processing individual digits. It is less
            intuitive than comparison-based sorts like QuickSort or MergeSort
            and requires a good understanding of digit manipulation.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bucket Sort:</strong>
          <div>
            Why Not Mastered: Bucket sort distributes elements into buckets and
            sorts them individually. Understanding when and how to effectively
            use this sort, along with its implementation details, can be
            challenging.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heap Sort:</strong>
          <div>
            Why Not Mastered: Heap sort relies on a binary heap data structure,
            and understanding heap operations (insertion, deletion) is crucial.
            The dual nature of heap construction and sorting phase can be
            complex to master.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Counting Sort:</strong>
          <div>
            Why Not Mastered: Counting sort is efficient for a limited range of
            integers but requires understanding of array manipulation for
            counting occurrences. It is less commonly used compared to other
            sorts, making it harder to practice regularly.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Reasons for Not Mastering</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lack of Regular Practice:</strong> Many of these data
          structures and algorithms require consistent practice to understand
          and implement effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Complexity:</strong> Some of these structures and algorithms
          are inherently complex and require a deep understanding of the
          underlying principles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Specific Use Cases:</strong> Some are used in very specific
          scenarios (e.g., tries for string manipulations, segment trees for
          range queries) which might not come up frequently in everyday coding
          tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Resources and Examples:</strong> Limited exposure to problems
          and resources that effectively teach and apply these concepts.
        </li>
